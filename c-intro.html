<p>Introducing LibreOffice and its main features.</p>

<section data-hd-class="concept/example">
<p> LibreOffice <em>(Figure 1)</em> is a free and open source software. It is designed and built by a community of people around the globe. 
It's main goal is to provide a free and libre software to create different documents. 
Originally LibreOffice was OpenOffice, but after OpenOffice SunMicro was acquired by Oracle,
some original creators of OpenOffice forked it and started a LibreOffice in 2010. Since then, there are 
around 80 million of users.</p>
